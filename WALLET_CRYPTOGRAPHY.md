## 1. Introduction to Cryptographic Wallets 🏦
### 1.1 What is a Blockchain Wallet?
Think of a blockchain wallet as your digital command center 🎮 - it's not a storage box, but rather your control panel for managing crypto on the blockchain. Here's what it handles:

- 🔑 Cryptographic keys: Your digital security system
- 📝 Address generation: Creating your blockchain identity
- ✍️ Transaction creation: Crafting and signing transfers
- ✅ Transaction verification: Making sure everything's legit
- 💰 Balance tracking: Keeping tabs on your assets

Remember: Your crypto stays on the blockchain - your wallet is just the control panel that lets you manage it!

### 1.2 The Importance of Cryptographic Wallets
Your crypto's security is all about those private keys 🔐. They're like the master key to your digital safe:

- 👑 Ownership proof: Only you can prove you own your assets
- ✍️ Transaction authorization: Your key, your rules
- 🎭 Identity management: Your blockchain identity

As Andreas Antonopoulos says, "Not your keys, not your coins" - it's like saying "Not your safe key, not your valuables!" 🏦

### 1.3 Types of Wallets
Wallets come in different flavors, like a digital security toolkit 🛠️:

- ❄️ Cold wallets: Your offline fortress (hardware wallets, paper wallets)
- 🔥 Hot wallets: Always connected (desktop, mobile, web wallets)
- 🏢 Custodial wallets: Someone else holds your keys
- 🛡️ Non-custodial wallets: You're in control of your keys
- 🌱 Deterministic wallets: One seed, many keys
- 🎲 Non-deterministic wallets: Random key generation

> For this project, we're building a non-custodial, deterministic wallet - because we like being in the driver's seat! 🎮

## 2. Asymmetric Cryptography Fundamentals 🔑
### 2.1 Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography
Let's break down these two cryptographic powerhouses 💪:

Symmetric cryptography (the straightforward one):
- 🔄 Same key for locking and unlocking
- 🚀 Super fast for big data
- Examples: `AES`, `ChaCha20`

Asymmetric cryptography (the sophisticated one):
- 🔐 Private key: Your secret weapon
- 🔑 Public key: Share it with the world
- 🔒 Lock with one, unlock with the other
- Examples: `RSA`, `ECDSA`, `Ed25519`

Blockchains use asymmetric crypto because it's like having a secure ID system that can prove you're you without sharing your secrets!

### 2.2 Mathematical Foundations 
The security of asymmetric cryptography rests on mathematical problems that are:

- Easy to compute in one direction (forward operation)
- Computationally infeasible to reverse (inverse operation)

These are known as one-way functions or trapdoor functions.
Major asymmetric cryptosystems are based on:

- Integer factorization problem (`RSA`):
    - Easy: Multiply two large prime numbers
    - Hard: Factor the resulting product back into its prime components
    - Example: `13 × 17 = 221` is easy, but factoring `221` is harder

- Discrete logarithm problem (`Diffie-Hellman`, `DSA`):
    - Easy: Calculate `g^x mod p`
    - Hard: Find `x` given `g^x mod p`
    - Based on modular exponentiation in finite fields
    - Example: Computing `5^13 mod 23 = 21` is straightforward; but given `5^x mod 23 = 21`, finding `x = 13` requires trial and error

- Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (`ECDSA`, `EdDSA`):
    - Easy: Multiply a point on an elliptic curve by an integer
    - Hard: Find the integer given the original and result points
    - Example: Computing `5 × (3,6) = (47,39)` on curve `y² = x³ + 2x + 3 (mod 97)`; but given `k × (3,6) = (47,39)`, finding `k = 5` requires trial and error
    - For cryptographic curves (e.g., `secp256k1`), with `~2^256` possible values, this is computationally infeasible
    - Most modern blockchains use this approach for superior security with smaller keys

> - Hard: Find the integer given the original and result points

> This one-way function provides the security foundation for the wallet system.

### 2.3 Key Pairs and Their Properties
Public-key cryptography provides several critical properties:

- Key pair correlation:
    - Each private key maps to exactly one public key
    - The mapping function is deterministic (same input always produces same output)
    - The function is non-reversible (can't derive private key from public key)

- Digital signing:
    - Private key creates signatures
    - Public key verifies signatures
    - Signatures prove message origin and integrity

- Mathematical guarantees:
    - Security is based on well-studied mathematical problems
    - Quantum computers potentially threaten current systems (particularly `RSA`)
    - Post-quantum cryptography is being developed to address these concerns

> In this project's implemented system:
> - Each private key maps to exactly one public key
> - Private keys are securely stored in encrypted form
> - The public key is used to derive the wallet address
> - Signatures prove message origin and integrity

## 3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in Detail 📈
### 3.1 What is an Elliptic Curve?
Picture a mathematical curve that looks like a roller coaster 🎢:
`y² = x³ + ax + b`

This isn't just any curve - it's a special one that creates a secure playground for cryptography! Think of it as a mathematical security system.

For cryptographic applications, these curves are used over finite fields (modulo a prime number `p`), creating a discrete set of points rather than a continuous curve. These points form a mathematical group with special properties:

- Point addition: Any two points on the curve can be "added" to produce another point
- Point doubling: A point can be "doubled" (added to itself)
- Scalar multiplication: A point can be multiplied by an integer

The fundamental operation in ECC is scalar multiplication:
`Q = k × G`
where:

- `G` is a predefined generator point on the curve
- `k` is a private key (a random integer)
- `Q` is the resulting public key (another point on the curve)

Computing `Q` given `k` and `G` is efficient, but finding `k` given `Q` and `G` (the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem) is computationally infeasible with current technology.

> This project's implementation uses elliptic curve cryptography with the `secp256k1` curve.

### 3.2 The secp256k1 Curve
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other blockchain platforms use the `secp256k1` curve. Its parameters are:

- `y² = x³ + 7` (`a=0`, `b=7`)
- Prime field modulus: `2²⁵⁶ - 2³² - 977`
- Base point (`G`) coordinates defined in the SEC standard
- Order (`n`): `~1.158 × 10⁷⁷` (slightly less than `2²⁵⁶`)

The `secp256k1` curve has several advantageous properties:

- Performance: Selected for efficient computation
- Security: No known backdoors or special structure vulnerabilities
- Simplicity: Simpler implementation than some alternatives

Unlike curves chosen by NIST (like `P-256`), `secp256k1` wasn't created by government agencies, reducing concerns about potential backdoors.

> This project's implementation uses the `secp256k1` curve through the cryptography library:
> ```python
> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
> private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256K1())
> ```
>  ...

### 3.3 Why ECC for Blockchains?
Blockchains use `ECC` rather than older asymmetric cryptography for several reasons:

- Key size efficiency: 256-bit `ECC` keys provide security comparable to 3072-bit `RSA` keys
- Computational efficiency: `ECC` operations are faster and require less memory
- Bandwidth efficiency: Smaller keys and signatures reduce blockchain size
- Battery efficiency: Important for mobile wallet applications

The table below compares ECC with `RSA` security levels:

| Security Level | RSA Key Size | ECC Key Size |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 80 bits        | 1024 bits    | 160 bits     |
| 112 bits       | 2048 bits    | 224 bits     |
| 128 bits       | 3072 bits    | 256 bits     |
| 192 bits       | 7680 bits    | 384 bits     |
| 256 bits       | 15360 bits   | 512 bits     |

>This project's implementation uses `ECC` for its efficiency and security benefits:
> - 256-bit `ECC` keys provide security comparable to much larger `RSA` keys
> - More efficient computation and smaller signatures
> - Industry standard for blockchain systems

### 3.4 ECC Mathematical Operations
The fundamental operations in `ECC` are:

- Point Addition: Adding two different points `P` and `Q` to get a third point `R`
    - Geometrically: Draw a line through `P` and `Q`, find where it intersects the curve, reflect across the x-axis
    - Algebraically: Several steps involving coordinates and modular arithmetic

- Point Doubling: Adding a point to itself (`P + P = 2P`)
    - Geometrically: Draw the tangent line at `P`, find where it intersects the curve, reflect
    - Algebraically: Different formula than point addition

- Scalar Multiplication: Multiplying a point by an integer `k`
    - Computed using a combination of point additions and doublings
    - Efficiently implemented using the "double and add" algorithm

These operations form the foundation of key generation and digital signatures in `ECC`.

> This project's implementation leverages the cryptography library to handle these operations:
> - Key generation
> - `ECDSA` signing
> - Signature verification

## 4. Wallet Components 🧩
### 4.1 Private Keys
Your private key is like the master password to your digital safe 🔐:

- 🎲 A random number between 1 and the curve's order
- 📏 For `secp256k1`, that's a 256-bit integer (32 bytes)
- 💪 Represents total control over your blockchain assets
- 🤫 Must stay secret - like your safe combination!

Generation Requirements:

- True randomness: Must use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Full entropy: Should use all 256 bits of potential space
- Range validation: Must be within the valid range (`1` to `n-1`)

Example of secure private key generation in Python:
```python
def _generate_validated_private_key(self) -> ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey:
    """Generate a private key with enhanced entropy that passes validation."""
    import hashlib
    import time

    max_attempts = 5

    for _attempt in range(max_attempts):
        entropy_sources = []
        entropy_sources.append(os.urandom(32))
        entropy_sources.append(str(time.time_ns()).encode())
        entropy_sources.append(str(id({})).encode())

        combined_entropy = hashlib.sha3_512(b"".join(entropy_sources)).digest()

        curve = ec.SECP256K1()
        temp_key = ec.generate_private_key(curve)
        temp_num = temp_key.private_numbers().private_value

        entropy_int = int.from_bytes(combined_entropy, byteorder="big")
        valid_key_value = (entropy_int % (temp_num - 1)) + 1

        candidate_key = ec.derive_private_key(valid_key_value, curve)

        private_hex = format(valid_key_value, "x").zfill(64)
        try:
            self._validate_private_key_strength(private_hex)
            return candidate_key

        except ValueError:
            continue

    return ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256K1())
```
Encoding and Storage:
Private keys can be encoded in several formats:

- Raw binary: 32 bytes of binary data
- Hexadecimal: 64 hex characters
- `Base58Check`: Used in Bitcoin `WIF` (Wallet Import Format)
- Encrypted: Protected by a password or other access control

> In this project's implemented system, private keys are:
> - Generated securely using the cryptography library
> - Never stored in plaintext form
> - Encrypted using AES-GCM with a password-derived key
> - Accessible only with the correct password
> ```python
> def _encrypt_private_key(self, private_key: ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey) -> bytes:
>     """Encrypt the private key with a password."""
>     salt = self._verification_salt
>     hashed_password = self._password_hash
>     aesgcm = AESGCM(hashed_password)
>     private_key_numbers = private_key.private_numbers()
>     private_key_bytes = format(private_key_numbers.private_value, "x").zfill(64).encode()
>     nonce = os.urandom(12)
>     ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, private_key_bytes, None)
>     return salt + nonce + ciphertext
> ```
>...

### 4.2 Public Keys
The public key is derived from the private key through scalar multiplication:
`Public Key = Private Key × G`
where `G` is the generator point of the curve.
Key characteristics:

- For `secp256k1`, the public key is a point with `x` and `y` coordinates
- Each coordinate is a 256-bit integer
- Typically represented as a compressed or uncompressed format

Compression Formats:

- Uncompressed format:
    - Both `x` and `y` coordinates (65 bytes)
    - Format: `0x04 + x + y`

- Compressed format:
    - Only the `x`-coordinate plus a prefix indicating `y`'s parity (33 bytes)
    - Format: `0x02` (even `y`) or `0x03` (odd `y`) `+ x`
    - The `y`-coordinate can be calculated from `x` due to the curve equation

Compressed public keys are preferred in blockchain systems for efficiency.
Example public key derivation:
```python
def get_public_key_hex(self) -> str:
    """Get the public key as a hex string with 0x prefix."""
    public_key_bytes = self.public_key.public_bytes(
        encoding=Encoding.X962, format=PublicFormat.UncompressedPoint
    )
    return "0x" + public_key_bytes.hex()
```

> This project's implementation derives public keys from private keys:
> ```python
> def get_public_key_hex(self) -> str:
>     """Get the public key as a hex string with 0x prefix."""
>     public_key_bytes = self.public_key.public_bytes(
>         encoding=Encoding.X962, format=PublicFormat.UncompressedPoint
>     )
>     return "0x" + public_key_bytes.hex()
>```
> The public key is used for:
> - Deriving the wallet address
> - Verifying signatures

### 4.3 Key Derivation Paths
Modern wallets use hierarchical deterministic (HD) key generation, allowing:

- Multiple keys from a single seed
- Organizational structure through derivation paths
- Reproducible generation across devices

The `BIP-32`, `BIP-44`, and `BIP-49` standards define how keys are organized:
`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`
For example:

- `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`: First Bitcoin address, first account
- `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`: First Ethereum address, first account

The apostrophes indicate "hardened" derivation, which provides additional security by preventing parent public keys from deriving child private keys.

> The current implementation uses direct key generation rather than hierarchical deterministic (HD) derivation. Each wallet contains a single keypair rather than derived child keys.

## 5. Cryptographic Operations 🔐
### 5.1 Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are like your blockchain fingerprint 👆:

- ✅ Prove you created the transaction
- 🔒 Verify nothing's been tampered with
- 🛡️ Stop transaction forgery in its tracks

Blockchains commonly use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (`ECDSA`) or `EdDSA` (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for signatures.
### 5.2 ECDSA in Detail
The `ECDSA` signing process involves:

- Hash calculation: Create a cryptographic hash of the transaction data
- Random nonce generation: Generate a secure random number `k`
- `R` point calculation: Calculate `R = k × G`
- Signature calculation: Compute `s = k⁻¹(z + r × privateKey) mod n`
    Where `z` is the hash, `r` is the `x`-coordinate of `R`

The resulting signature is the pair (`r`, `s`).
Critical security considerations:

- The nonce `k` must be unique for each signature
- Reusing `k` for different messages reveals the private key
- The Sony PlayStation 3 was hacked due to a nonce reuse vulnerability

A more secure variant, deterministic `ECDSA` (`RFC 6979`), derives the nonce from the private key and message, eliminating the risk of nonce reuse.
Example of `ECDSA` signing:
```python
def sign_transaction(self, transaction_data: dict, password: str) -> bytes:
    """Sign transaction data with the wallet's private key."""
    if not self._verify_password(password):
        raise ValueError("Failed to sign transaction. Invalid wallet password.")
    data_bytes = orjson.dumps(transaction_data, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)
    message_hash = Wallet._get_keccak_hash(data_bytes)
    private_key = self._decrypt_private_key(self._encrypted_key)
    signature = private_key.sign(message_hash, ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
    return signature
```

> This project's implementation uses ECDSA signing with SHA-256 through the cryptography library:
> ```python
> def sign_transaction(self, transaction_data: dict, password: str) -> bytes:
>     """Sign transaction data with the wallet's private key."""
>     if not self._verify_password(password):
>         raise ValueError("Failed to sign transaction. Invalid wallet password.")
>     data_bytes = orjson.dumps(transaction_data, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)
>     message_hash = Wallet._get_keccak_hash(data_bytes)
>     private_key = self._decrypt_private_key(self._encrypted_key)
>     signature = private_key.sign(message_hash, ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
>     return signature
> ```
> ...

### 5.3 Signature Verification
Anyone with the public key can verify a signature:

- Hash calculation: Create the same hash of the transaction data
- Signature validation: Verify that the signature mathematically corresponds to the hash and public key

The verification process proves that:

- The signer had access to the private key
- The transaction data hasn't been modified

Example of signature verification:
```python
@staticmethod
def verify_signature(transaction_data: dict, signature: bytes, public_key_bytes: bytes) -> bool:
    """Verify a transaction's signature."""
    try:
        data_bytes = orjson.dumps(transaction_data, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)
        message_hash = Wallet._get_keccak_hash(obj=data_bytes)
        public_key = ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point(
            ec.SECP256K1(), public_key_bytes
        )
        public_key.verify(signature, message_hash, ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
```

> This project's implementation verifies signatures as follows:
> ```python
> @staticmethod
> def verify_signature(transaction_data: dict, signature: bytes, public_key_bytes: bytes) -> bool:
>     """Verify a transaction's signature."""
>     try:
>         data_bytes = orjson.dumps(transaction_data, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)
>         message_hash = Wallet._get_keccak_hash(obj=data_bytes)
>         public_key = ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point(
>             ec.SECP256K1(), public_key_bytes
>         )
>         public_key.verify(signature, message_hash, ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
>         return True
>     except Exception:
>         return False
> ```
> ...

### 5.4 Signature Malleability
`ECDSA` signatures have a property called malleability - for any valid signature (`r`, `s`), the signature (`r`, `n-s`) is also valid. This can cause transaction identifier inconsistencies.
Bitcoin addressed this with `BIP-66`, requiring `s` values to be in the lower half of the range, making signatures canonical.
### 5.5 Alternative Signature Schemes
While `ECDSA` is common, other signature schemes offer advantages:

- Schnorr signatures:
    - Implemented in Bitcoin via the Taproot upgrade
    - Simpler, more efficient design
    - Native support for key aggregation and threshold signatures
    - Non-malleable by design

- `EdDSA` (`Ed25519`):
    - Used by Cardano, Polkadot, and others
    - Based on twisted Edwards curves
    - Deterministic by design (no random nonce)
    - Resistant to side-channel attacks
    - Faster than `ECDSA`

### 5.6 Signature Encapsulation
This project's implementation encapsulates signature data in a dedicated class:
```python
class TransactionSignature(BaseModel):
    signature: str | None = Field(default=None)
    public_key: str | None = Field(default=None)

    def sign(self, transaction_data: dict, wallet: "Wallet", password: str) -> bool:
        """Sign transaction data with the provided wallet."""
        try:
            signature_bytes = wallet.sign_transaction(transaction_data, password)
            self.signature = "0x" + signature_bytes.hex()
            self.public_key = wallet.get_public_key_hex()
            return True
        except Exception:
            return False

    def verify(self, transaction_data: dict) -> bool:
        """Verify the signature against transaction data."""
        from app.models import Wallet

        if not self.signature or not self.public_key:
            return False
        signature = self.signature[2:] if self.signature.startswith("0x") else self.signature
        public_key = self.public_key[2:] if self.public_key.startswith("0x") else self.public_key
        try:
            return Wallet.verify_signature(
                transaction_data, bytes.fromhex(signature), bytes.fromhex(public_key)
            )
        except Exception:
            return False
```
## 6. Address Formats and Derivation 📝
### 6.1 Bitcoin-style Addresses
Creating a Bitcoin address is like crafting a unique digital ID card 🪪:

- 🔐 Hash the public key (SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160)
- 🏷️ Add version byte (like a network ID)
- ✅ Calculate checksum (like a security seal)
- 🎨 Encode with Base58 (making it human-friendly)

Example of Bitcoin address derivation:
```python
import hashlib
import base58

def create_bitcoin_address(public_key_bytes):
    """Create a Bitcoin address from a public key."""
    # SHA-256 hash of the public key
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(public_key_bytes).digest()
    
    # RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash
    ripemd160 = hashlib.new('ripemd160')
    ripemd160.update(sha256_hash)
    hash160 = ripemd160.digest()
    
    # Add version byte (0x00 for mainnet)
    versioned_hash = b'\x00' + hash160
    
    # Double SHA-256 for checksum
    checksum = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(versioned_hash).digest()).digest()[:4]
    
    # Combine and encode
    address_bytes = versioned_hash + checksum
    address = base58.b58encode(address_bytes).decode('utf-8')
    
    return address
```
Address Types:
Bitcoin has evolved several address formats:

- `P2PKH` (Pay to Public Key Hash):
    - Traditional format starting with `'1'`
    - Example: `1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`

- `P2SH` (Pay to Script Hash):
    - Starts with `'3'`
    - Supports multi-signature and scripts
    - Example: `3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy`

- `Bech32` (`SegWit`):
    - Starts with `'bc1'`
    - Better error detection
    - Example: `bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4`

### 6.2 Ethereum Addresses
Ethereum uses a simpler process:

- Hash the public key:
    - `Keccak-256` hash of the uncompressed public key (without the `0x04` prefix)

- Take the last 20 bytes:
    - This gives a 160-bit (20-byte) identifier

- Add prefix:
    - Prefix with `'0x'` for readability
    - Example: `0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F`

Ethereum addresses are case-sensitive, and the capitalization serves as an optional checksum (`EIP-55`).

Example of Ethereum address derivation:
```python
from Crypto.Hash import keccak

def create_ethereum_address(public_key_bytes):
    """Create an Ethereum address from a public key."""
    # Convert to uncompressed if it's compressed
    if public_key_bytes[0] in (0x02, 0x03):
        # Decompress point - this is simplified
        # In practice, you'd calculate the y coordinate
        # from the x coordinate using the curve equation
        uncompressed_key = decompress_public_key(public_key_bytes)
    else:
        uncompressed_key = public_key_bytes
    
    # Remove the prefix byte (0x04)
    if uncompressed_key[0] == 0x04:
        key_without_prefix = uncompressed_key[1:]
    else:
        key_without_prefix = uncompressed_key
    
    # Keccak-256 hash
    k = keccak.new(digest_bits=256)
    k.update(key_without_prefix)
    
    # Take last 20 bytes and add 0x prefix
    hex_address = k.hexdigest()[-40:]
    
    # Apply EIP-55 checksum if desired
    checksum_address = apply_eip55_checksum(hex_address)
    
    return checksum_address
```

### 6.3 Other Address Formats
Different blockchains use variations of these techniques:

- Ripple (`XRP`):
    - `Base58` encoding with a different dictionary
    - Uses a `"0"` prefix byte
    - Example: `rBPe1UcgvDjEbLDLXn9J29N7Z6hmwQAJva`

- Cosmos:
    - `Bech32` encoding with human-readable prefix
    - Example: `cosmos1abcd...`

- Polkadot:
    - `SS58` format, a modified `Base58`
    - Uses different prefixes for different networks
    - Example: `15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5`

### 6.4 Vanity Addresses
Vanity addresses contain specific patterns (like names or words) and are created by:

- Generating many key pairs until one produces an address with the desired pattern
- The process is computationally intensive (brute force)
- Longer patterns become exponentially harder to find

For example, an address starting with `"1Love"` might take hours or days to generate.

## 7. Implementation with Python 🐍
### 7.1 Selecting a Cryptographic Library
Choosing the right crypto library is like picking your security toolkit 🛠️:

- `cryptography`: The all-rounder champion
- `coincurve`: The speed demon
- `ecdsa`: The simple but steady
- `pynacl`: The modern warrior

For blockchain development, `coincurve` or `cryptography` are recommended:

- Use `coincurve` for maximum performance with `secp256k1`
- Use `cryptography` for broader cryptographic needs

Installation:
```bash
pip install coincurve cryptography
```

> This project's implementation uses these libraries:
> - `cryptography`: For core ECC operations and AES encryption
> - `pycryptodome (Crypto)`: For Keccak-256 hashing
> - `orjson`: For deterministic JSON serialization
> - `hmac`: For constant-time password verification

### 7.2 Complete Wallet Implementation
The core `Wallet` class implements:

- Password-based encryption of private keys
- Address generation with EIP-55 checksum
- Transaction signing and verification
- Keystore export/import for wallet backup and recovery
```python
class Wallet:
    def __init__(
        self,
        password: str,
        encrypted_key: bytes | None = None,
        private_key_hex: str | None = None,
        verification_salt: bytes | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize a [password-protected] wallet with an existing private key or generate a new one."""
        self._verification_salt = verification_salt if verification_salt else os.urandom(16)
        self._password_hash = self._hash_password(password)
        if encrypted_key:
            private_key = self._decrypt_private_key(encrypted_key)
        elif private_key_hex:
            if private_key_hex.startswith("0x"):
                private_key_hex = private_key_hex[2:]
            private_key_value = int(private_key_hex, base=16)
            private_key = ec.derive_private_key(private_key_value, ec.SECP256K1())
        else:
            private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256K1())
        self._encrypted_key = self._encrypt_private_key(private_key)
        self.public_key = private_key.public_key()
        self.address = self._generate_address()
        del private_key
```
### 7.3 Integrating with Blockchain Transactions
The `Transaction` class implements:

- Transaction data structure
- Cryptographic hash calculation
- Signature integration
- Blockchain integration

```python
class Transaction(BaseModel):
    class TransactionStatus(StrEnum):
        PENDING = "pending"
        CONFIRMED = "confirmed"
        FAILED = "failed"

    nonce: int = Field(default=0, ge=0)
    sender: str = Field(default="")
    recipient: str = Field(default="")
    amount: float = Field(default=0, ge=0.0)
    status: str = Field(default=TransactionStatus.PENDING)
    timestamp: int = Field(default_factory=lambda: int(datetime.now().timestamp()))
    block_index: int | None = Field(default=None, exclude=True)
    message: str | None = Field(default=None, max_length=500)
    transaction_hash: str = Field(default="")
    signature_data: Optional["TransactionSignature"] = Field(default=None)

    def sign(self, wallet: "Wallet", password: str) -> bool:
        """
        Sign the transaction with the provided wallet.
        Delegates to the TransactionSignature class.
        """
        from app.models import TransactionSignature

        if self.sender == "0x":
            return True
        if self.sender.lower() != wallet.address.lower():
            raise ValueError("Cannot sign transaction for other wallets")
        if not self.signature_data:
            self.signature_data = TransactionSignature()
        return self.signature_data.sign(self.transaction_data, wallet, password)
```
### 7.4 Blockchain Integration
The `Transaction` and `Wallet` classes integrate with the `Blockchain` class through:

- Transaction validation
- Nonce management
- Signature verification
```python
def add_to_blockchain(
    self, blockchain: "Blockchain", wallet: Optional["Wallet"] = None
) -> bool:
    """
    Add a transaction to a pending pool if valid or future queue.
    For non-system transactions, a signature is required.
    """
    from app.utils.validators import TransactionValidator

    if not TransactionValidator.validate_basic_fields(self):
        return False
    if self.sender == "0x":
        self.nonce = 0
        if not TransactionValidator.validate_transaction(self, blockchain.account_nonces):
            return False
        blockchain.transactions_by_hash[self.transaction_hash] = self
        blockchain.pending_transactions.append(self)
        return True
    if not wallet:
        return False
    expected_nonce = blockchain.account_nonces.get(self.sender, 0) + 1
    if self.nonce == 0:
        self.nonce = expected_nonce
    if self.nonce == expected_nonce:
        if not TransactionValidator.validate_transaction(self, blockchain.account_nonces):
            return False
        blockchain.transactions_by_hash[self.transaction_hash] = self
        blockchain.pending_transactions.append(self)
        blockchain.account_nonces[self.sender] = self.nonce
        return True
    elif self.nonce > expected_nonce:
        if not TransactionValidator.validate_transaction(
            self, blockchain.account_nonces, check_nonce=False
        ):
            return False
        blockchain.transactions_by_hash[self.transaction_hash] = self
        blockchain.future_transactions.setdefault(self.sender, {})[self.nonce] = self
        return True
    return False
```

We protect your keys like a bank vault 🏦:

- 🔐 AES-GCM encryption
- 🔑 PBKDF2 key derivation
- 🔒 100,000 iterations of security

### 8.2 Keystore Export/Import
This project's implementation supports wallet backup and recovery through encrypted keystore:
```python
def export_encrypted_keystore(self, password: str) -> dict:
    """Export the encrypted keystore for backup or storage."""
    if not self._verify_password(password):
        raise ValueError("Failed to export keystore. Invalid wallet password.")
    return {
        "encrypted_key": self._encrypted_key,
        "verification_salt": self._verification_salt,
    }

@classmethod
def restore_from_keystore(cls, keystore: dict, password: str) -> "Wallet":
    """Restore a wallet from an exported keystore."""
    if not isinstance(keystore, dict):
        raise ValueError("Invalid keystore format")
    encrypted_key = keystore.get("encrypted_key")
    verification_salt = keystore.get("verification_salt")
    if not encrypted_key or not verification_salt:
        raise ValueError("Incomplete keystore data")
    return cls(
        password=password,
        encrypted_key=encrypted_key,
        verification_salt=verification_salt,
    )
```
### 8.3 Future Transaction Handling
The blockchain implementation supports queuing future transactions with higher nonces:
```python
def _process_future_transactions(self, sender: str) -> None:
    """Process any queued future transactions that are now valid."""
    if sender not in self.future_transactions:
        return
    expected_nonce = self.account_nonces.get(sender, 0) + 1
    while expected_nonce in self.future_transactions[sender]:
        transaction = self.future_transactions[sender].pop(expected_nonce)
        self.pending_transactions.append(transaction)
        self.account_nonces[sender] = expected_nonce
        expected_nonce += 1
    if not self.future_transactions[sender]:
        del self.future_transactions[sender]
```
